# Rails and Ruby Best Practices

## Project Context

- **Server**: API-only Rails project on PostgreSQL. Always use the latest stable versions of Ruby and Rails.
- **Data**: Raw bible import data is from this project https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases which is checked out at `../bible_databases`
- **Frontend**: Angular with Bootstrap project with code located at `../bibler-ui`
- **Goal**: Maintainable, simple, dependency-light codebase

## Ruby/Rails Best Practices

- Use Rails CLI for all operations (generate, build, serve)
- Follow Rails style guide: controllers, models etc
- Strongly prefer Rails OR/M usage over custom SQL statements.

## Data
- NEVER change the text or context of a bible verse
- Always support handling of non-English data files

## Minimal Dependencies

- Avoid adding new gems unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer Rails features over third-party libraries
- Review existing dependencies before adding new ones
- Keep `Gemfile` lean and well-documented

## Maintenance Focus

- Write clear, readable code over clever solutions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep components small and focused
- Prefer code reusable logic over duplication
- Document non-obvious code decisions
- Remove dead/commented code regularly
- Documentation should be concise, non-duplicative, and oriented towards a technical audience
